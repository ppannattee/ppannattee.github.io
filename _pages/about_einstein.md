I am Peerawat Pannattee, a Ph.D. student at Tokyo Metropolitan University, specializing in the application of deep learning for user experience (UX) assessment in virtual reality (VR) environments. Born and raised in Thailand, I earned my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication and my M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Bangkok, Thailand, in 2019 and 2022, respectively.

During my Master's research, I focused on the challenging problem of fingerspelling recognition from continuous videos, where factors such as background, frame rate, camera distance, signer variation, and signing speed add significant complexity. My deep learning-based approach to this problem achieved state-of-the-art results and allowed me to gain profound knowledge in video processing using AI techniques. This experience sparked my interest in exploring AI's potential applications for analyzing human behavior and responses, particularly in immersive environments like VR.

In 2022, I was honored to receive the prestigious Japanese Government (MEXT) Scholarship, enabling me to pursue a Ph.D. at Tokyo Metropolitan University. My current research is centered on using deep learning to assess various aspects of user experience in VR, including cybersickness, emotional state, and the sense of presence. I am excited by the potential of VR as a powerful tool for studying human behavior and psychology, and my work is helping to pave the way for AI-driven analysis in these domains.
