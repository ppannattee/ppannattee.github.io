description: A passionate researcher with a strong foundation in deep learning and its applications in human behavior and psychology. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Tokyo Metropolitan University, I specialize in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on factors such as cybersickness, presence, and emotional state. My goal is to advance the understanding of human cognition and behavior through the integration of VR technologies and AI, exploring their potential to unlock new insights into the mind and human experience.
