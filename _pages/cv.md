description: A passionate researcher with a strong foundation in deep learning and its applications in both image, video, and time-serries data. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Tokyo Metropolitan University, I specialize in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on factors such as cybersickness, presence, and emotional state. My goal is to advance the understanding of human cognition and behavior through the integration of VR technologies and AI, while also exploring the potential of AI to drive innovation across various domains. I am eager to apply my expertise to diverse fields, leveraging AI to solve complex problems and unlock new possibilities in both research and real-world applications.
