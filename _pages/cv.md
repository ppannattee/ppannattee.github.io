description: A passionate and innovative researcher with a strong foundation in deep learning and its applications in human behavior and psychology. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Tokyo Metropolitan University, I specialize in the use of artificial intelligence to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on factors such as cybersickness, presence, and emotional state. My goal is to advance the understanding of human cognition and behavior through VR technologies and AI, while contributing to the development of cutting-edge solutions in human-computer interaction.
