I am Peerawat Pannattee, a Ph.D. student at Tokyo Metropolitan University, where I focus on leveraging deep learning to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR) environments. Born and raised in Thailand, I pursued my academic journey at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Bangkok, where I earned both my B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication (2019) and M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering (2022).

During my Master's research, I delved into fingerspelling recognition from video data, which posed significant challenges due to variations in factors like background, frame rate, camera distance, signing speed, and signer differences. This research, which aimed to process continuous videos using deep learning, allowed me to develop a method that achieved state-of-the-art results in the field. This success sparked my passion for exploring the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in human behavior analysis, leading me to investigate the intersection of AI, VR, and psychology.

My current research involves using deep learning techniques to study how user interactions and movements in VR environments can be analyzed to assess UX elements such as cybersickness, sense of presence, and emotional states. The controlled and immersive nature of VR provides an ideal platform for studying human behavior and cognition, which has motivated me to explore how AI can enhance UX in VR applications, making them more effective tools for research and practical use.

As I continue my Ph.D. studies, I am excited to push the boundaries of AI and VR, with a vision to develop smarter and more intuitive systems for human-computer interaction in virtual spaces
