I am a Ph.D. student at Tokyo Metropolitan University, specializing in deep learning and virtual reality (VR). My research uses AI to analyze user experience (UX) in VR, focusing on factors such as cybersickness, presence, and emotional states, with the aim of improving user interaction with immersive technologies.

I hold an M.E. in Electrical Engineering from KMUTT, where I developed advanced methods for fingerspelling recognition in dynamic, real-world video environments, strengthening my expertise in AI applications for complex, real-world problems.

My goal is to leverage VR and AI to deepen our understanding of human cognition and behavior, exploring how these technologies can unlock new insights into the mind and human experience.

Feel free to reach out for further information.
