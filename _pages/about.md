Hi, I'm Peerawat, but I also go by TK. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Tokyo Metropolitan University](https://www.tmu.ac.jp/english/index.html), specializing in deep learning and virtual reality (VR). My research focuses on leveraging AI to analyze user experience (UX) in VR, with an emphasis on factors such as cybersickness, presence, and emotional states. The goal is to enhance user interaction with immersive technologies and improve the overall VR experience.

I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [KMUTT](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/), where I developed advanced methods for fingerspelling recognition in dynamic, [real-world video environments](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/ChicagoFSWild.htm). This work strengthened my expertise in applying AI to solve complex, real-world problems.

I am passionate about using VR and AI to explore human cognition and behavior, aiming to unlock new insights into the mind and human experience.

Feel free to reach out for more information.
