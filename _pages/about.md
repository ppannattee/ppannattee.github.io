Hi, I am Peerawat, but I also go by TK. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [Tokyo Metropolitan University](https://www.tmu.ac.jp/english/index.html), where my research centers on applying deep learning (DL) to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR), with an emphasis on factors such as [cybersickness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3670008), [presence](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628298/full), and emotional states. The goal is to enhance user interaction with immersive technologies and improve the overall VR experience.

I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [KMUTT](https://www.kmutt.ac.th/en/), where I developed advanced methods for continuous fingerspelling recognition in dynamic, [real-world video environments](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/ChicagoFSWild.htm). This work strengthened my expertise in applying AI to solve complex, real-world problems.

Beyond my current research, I have a personal interest in broader AI applicationsâ€”especially in vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). I am passionate about leveraging these technologies to solve challenging problems and drive innovation through intelligent, human-centered systems.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more.
