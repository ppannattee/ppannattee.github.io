I am a Ph.D. student at Tokyo Metropolitan University, specializing in deep learning techniques to assess user experience (UX) in virtual reality (VR). My research focuses on using AI to analyze user interactions and responses in VR environments, with a particular emphasis on cybersickness, sense of presence, and emotional states. By applying AI to these areas, I aim to enhance how users interact with immersive technologies and improve the overall experience.

I completed my M.E. in Electrical Engineering at KMUTT, Thailand, where my Master's research focused on fingerspelling recognition in challenging video settings, including variations in background, frame rate, and signer characteristics. My method achieved state-of-the-art results, significantly deepening my understanding of deep learning and its applications in real-world problems.

Currently, my research is centered on understanding human behavior and cognitive responses in VR, exploring how AI can help study and improve how we interact with virtual environments. This work contributes to the broader field of human-computer interaction (HCI), where technology is used to analyze and enhance user experience.

Outside of my academic work, I am passionate about exploring new AI applications, especially those that can advance our understanding of the mind and improve user-centric technology design.
