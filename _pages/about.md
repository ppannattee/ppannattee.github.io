I am a Ph.D. student at Tokyo Metropolitan University, specializing in deep learning and virtual reality (VR). My research leverages AI to analyze user experience (UX) in VR, with a focus on factors like cybersickness, presence, and emotional states, aiming to improve user interaction with immersive technologies.

I hold an M.E. in Electrical Engineering from KMUTT, where I developed state-of-the-art methods for fingerspelling recognition in dynamic, real-world video settings, further honing my expertise in AI applications to address complex, real-world challenges.

My goal is to advance the understanding of human cognition and behavior through VR and AI, contributing to the development of innovative solutions in human-computer interaction.

Feel free to contact me for further details or potential collaborations.
